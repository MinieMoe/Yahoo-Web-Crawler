# Yahoo-Web-Crawler
This is my contribution to a research group "Virtual Internet ELVIS", in which we simulate how the internet works. I was tasked to emulate the yahoo.com server
by creating a web crawler.
The crawler would start at http://yahoo.com, scrap all the links related to yahoo and image found on that website. For each link found, I have to recursively follow
it and scrap all links and image. I do that for all links till I scrap the entire of yahoo.com
Once I'm done scrapping, it will save all the data for links and images found in se

TO-DO: This web scrapper is supposed not to visit the links that are already visisted, but somehow, I still see duplicate links printed on the terminal.
